                      ForwardToken enables ID token forwarding for SSO.
                      When true, muster forwards the user's ID token to this server instead of
                      triggering a separate OAuth flow. The downstream server must be configured
                      to trust muster's client ID in its TrustedAudiences.

                  requiredAudiences:
                    description: |-
                      RequiredAudiences specifies additional audience(s) that the forwarded ID token
                      should contain. When ForwardToken is true, muster will request these audiences
                      from the upstream IdP (e.g., Dex) using cross-client scopes.

                      This is used when the downstream server requires tokens with specific audiences,
                      for example when forwarding tokens to Kubernetes for OIDC authentication:
                        requiredAudiences:
                          - "dex-k8s-authenticator"

                      At user authentication, muster collects all requiredAudiences from MCPServers
                      with forwardToken: true and requests them all from the IdP.

                      Teleport configures Teleport authentication for accessing private installations.
                      This is only used when Type is "teleport".

                      When configured, muster uses Teleport Machine ID certificates to establish
                      mutual TLS connections to MCP servers accessible via Teleport Application Access.

                          This is used to identify which Teleport-protected application to connect to.

                          Used in filesystem mode when certificates are mounted directly.
                          Example: /var/run/tbot/identity

                          tbot identity files. The secret should contain: tlscert, key, teleport-application-ca.pem
                          (matching tbot's application output type).
                          Required when running in Kubernetes mode.

                      TokenExchange enables SSO via RFC 8693 Token Exchange for cross-cluster SSO.
                      When configured, muster exchanges its local token for a token valid on the
                      remote cluster's Identity Provider (e.g., Dex).

                      Use TokenExchange when:
                        - The remote cluster has its own Dex instance
                        - The remote Dex is configured with an OIDC connector for muster's Dex
                        - You need a token issued by the remote cluster's IdP (not just forwarded)

                      Token exchange takes precedence over ForwardToken if both are configured.

                  Conditions represent the latest available observations of the MCPServer's current state.
                  Standard condition types:
                    - Ready: True if infrastructure is reachable (process running or TCP connectable)
                items:
                  description: Condition contains details for one aspect of the current
                    state of this API Resource.

                    lastTransitionTime:
                      description: |-
                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.

                        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                        with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
                        Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
                        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
                        The value should be a CamelCase string.
                        This field may not be empty.

                  LastAttempt indicates when the last connection attempt was made.

                  LastError contains any error message from the most recent server operation.
                  Note: Per-user authentication errors are tracked in the Session Registry,
