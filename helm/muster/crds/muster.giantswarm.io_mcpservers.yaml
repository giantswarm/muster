                      muster will trigger a separate OAuth flow for this server.

                      SSO controls Single Sign-On token reuse for this server.

                      can be reused to authenticate to this server without re-authenticating.
                      When false, this server always requires its own authentication flow,
                      even if a token exists for the same issuer. Use this when you want to
                      use different accounts for servers that share the same OAuth provider.

                      TokenExchange enables SSO via RFC 8693 Token Exchange for cross-cluster SSO.
                      When configured, muster exchanges its local token for a token valid on the
                      remote cluster's Identity Provider (e.g., Dex).

                      Use TokenExchange when:
                        - The remote cluster has its own Dex instance
                        - The remote Dex is configured with an OIDC connector for muster's Dex
                        - You need a token issued by the remote cluster's IdP (not just forwarded)

                      Token exchange takes precedence over ForwardToken if both are configured.
