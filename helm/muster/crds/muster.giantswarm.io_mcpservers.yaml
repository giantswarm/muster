                      When true and token forwarding fails (e.g., 401 response despite forwarded token),
                      muster will trigger a separate OAuth flow for this server.

                      SSO controls Single Sign-On token reuse for this server.

                      can be reused to authenticate to this server without re-authenticating.
                      When false, this server always requires its own authentication flow,
                      even if a token exists for the same issuer. Use this when you want to
                      use different accounts for servers that share the same OAuth provider.

                    description: |-
                      TokenExchange enables SSO via RFC 8693 Token Exchange for cross-cluster SSO.
                      When configured, muster exchanges its local token for a token valid on the
                      remote cluster's Identity Provider (e.g., Dex).

                      Use TokenExchange when:
                        - The remote cluster has its own Dex instance
                        - The remote Dex is configured with an OIDC connector for muster's Dex
                        - You need a token issued by the remote cluster's IdP (not just forwarded)

                      Token exchange takes precedence over ForwardToken if both are configured.
