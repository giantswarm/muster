  Tests that SSO servers can be reconnected after logout and re-login.
  
  This scenario tests the complete logout + re-login user flow:
  1. User authenticates to muster → connects to SSO server via core_auth_login
  2. User logs out from the SSO server → session connection is cleared
  3. User re-authenticates with SAME session ID but NEW token
  4. User can reconnect to SSO server via core_auth_login (token forwarding)
  
  This verifies that token forwarding works correctly across the full
  authentication lifecycle (login → logout → relogin).
