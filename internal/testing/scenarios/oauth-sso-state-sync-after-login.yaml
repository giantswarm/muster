  Tests the separation of infrastructure state (CRD Phase) from session state (auth://status).
  
  Per issue #292, the MCPServer CRD Phase reflects infrastructure availability:
  - Phase: Ready means the server is reachable (even if 401 auth required)
  - Phase: Failed means the server is unreachable
  
  Session state (per-user auth/connection) is tracked separately:
  - auth://status resource shows per-user connection state ("connected", "auth_required")
  
  This scenario tests that:
  1. Before auth: MCPServer Phase = Ready (server is reachable, returned 401)
  2. Before auth: auth://status shows "auth_required" for this session
  3. After SSO login: auth://status shows "connected" for this session
  4. After SSO login: MCPServer Phase remains Ready (infrastructure unchanged)
