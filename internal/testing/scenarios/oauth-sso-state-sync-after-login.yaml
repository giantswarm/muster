  Tests the separation of infrastructure state (CRD State) from session state (auth://status).
  
  The MCPServer CRD State reflects infrastructure availability with context-appropriate values:
  - Remote servers: Connected, Connecting, Disconnected, Failed
  - Stdio servers: Running, Starting, Stopped, Failed
  
  Session state (per-user auth/connection) is tracked separately:
  - auth://status resource shows per-user connection state ("connected", "auth_required")
  
  This scenario tests that:
  1. Before auth: MCPServer State = Connected (server is reachable, returned 401)
  2. Before auth: auth://status shows "auth_required" for this session
  3. After SSO login: auth://status shows "connected" for this session
  4. After SSO login: MCPServer State remains Connected (infrastructure unchanged)
