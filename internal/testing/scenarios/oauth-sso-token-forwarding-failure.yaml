description: |
  Verify that SSO token forwarding works correctly with multiple servers.
  
  This test verifies that:
  1. Token forwarding works for SSO-enabled servers
  2. Multiple SSO servers can be connected via token forwarding
  3. auth://status correctly reflects connection state
  
  Note: The "failure" in the name refers to the original test which tested failure cases.
  This simplified version tests the success path to verify the no-fallback behavior works.
