# Event Reference and Troubleshooting Guide

This comprehensive guide covers all Kubernetes events generated by muster during CRD lifecycle operations, providing detailed explanations, troubleshooting steps, and operational best practices.

## Overview

Muster automatically generates Kubernetes events for all major operations involving:
- **MCPServers**: Service lifecycle, tool discovery, health monitoring
- **ServiceClasses**: Availability tracking, validation, dependency resolution
- **Workflows**: Execution tracking, step monitoring, tool availability
- **Service Instances**: Instance lifecycle, health checks, tool execution

Events provide visibility into system behavior in both Kubernetes and filesystem modes, helping operators understand what's happening and troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Event Structure

All muster events include:
- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Resource**: The object the event relates to (MCPServer, ServiceClass, etc.)
- **Reason**: Short, machine-readable reason code
- **Message**: Human-readable description with context
- **Type**: Event severity (Normal or Warning)
- **Source**: Component that generated the event (`muster`)

## MCPServer Events

MCPServers are external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide tools to muster. Events track their lifecycle, health, and tool availability.

### CRD Management Events

### Event Analysis Patterns

#### Troubleshooting Service Issues
```bash
# 1. Check recent events for the service
muster events --resource-type service --resource-name my-app --since 1h

# 2. Check ServiceClass events
muster events --resource-type serviceclass --resource-name web-app --since 1h

# 3. Check MCPServer events for required tools
muster events --resource-type mcpserver --type Warning --since 1h
```

#### Monitoring Workflow Executions
```bash
# 1. Check workflow execution events
muster events --resource-type workflow --resource-name deploy-app --since 30m

# 2. Filter for execution-specific events
muster events --resource-type workflow | grep "execution"

# 3. Look for step failures
muster events --resource-type workflow --type Warning
```

#### Health Monitoring
```bash
# 1. Check for health-related warnings
muster events --type Warning | grep -i health

# 2. Monitor recovery events
muster events | grep -i recovery

# 3. Check tool availability issues
muster events | grep -i "unavailable\|missing"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: MCPServer Won't Start

**Symptoms:**
- `MCPServerFailed` events
- `MCPServerToolsUnavailable` events
- Tools missing from aggregator

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check recent MCPServer events
muster events --resource-type mcpserver --resource-name <server> --since 1h

# 2. Check server configuration
muster get mcpserver <server> --output yaml

# 3. Test server availability
muster check mcpserver <server>

# 4. Try manual start
muster start mcpserver <server>
```

**Common Causes:**
- Port already in use
- Invalid command or arguments
- Missing dependencies
- Permission issues
- Network connectivity problems

### Scenario 2: ServiceClass Unavailable

**Symptoms:**
- `ServiceClassUnavailable` events
- `ServiceClassToolsMissing` events
- Cannot create service instances

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check ServiceClass availability
muster check serviceclass <serviceclass>

# 2. Check which tools are missing
muster events --resource-type serviceclass --resource-name <serviceclass>

# 3. Check MCPServer status
muster list mcpserver

# 4. Start missing servers
muster start mcpserver <required-server>
```

### Scenario 3: Workflow Execution Fails

**Symptoms:**
- `WorkflowExecutionFailed` events
- `WorkflowStepFailed` events
- Incomplete workflow results

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check workflow execution events
muster events --resource-type workflow --resource-name <workflow> --since 30m

# 2. Get execution details
muster get workflow-execution <execution-id>

# 3. Test failed tool manually
muster agent --repl
# > call <failed-tool> {...}

# 4. Check tool availability
muster check workflow <workflow>
```

### Scenario 4: Service Instance Health Issues

**Symptoms:**
- `ServiceInstanceUnhealthy` events
- `ServiceInstanceHealthCheckFailed` events
- Service appears running but not responding

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check service health events
muster events --resource-type service --resource-name <service> | grep -i health

# 2. Check service status
muster get service <service>

# 3. Test health check manually
# (depends on ServiceClass health check tool)

# 4. Consider restart
muster restart service <service>
```

### Scenario 5: Tools Suddenly Unavailable

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple `ToolsUnavailable` events
- ServiceClasses become unavailable
- Workflows fail with tool errors

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check which MCPServers are affected
muster events --type Warning | grep -i "tools.*unavailable"

# 2. Check MCPServer status
muster list mcpserver

# 3. Check for connectivity issues
muster agent --repl
# > list tools

# 4. Restart affected servers
muster restart mcpserver <affected-server>
```

## Best Practices

### Event Monitoring

1. **Regular Health Checks**
   ```bash
   # Set up regular monitoring
   muster events --type Warning --since 1h
   ```

2. **Resource-Specific Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Monitor critical resources
   muster events --resource-type mcpserver --resource-name critical-server
   ```

3. **Automated Alerting**
   ```bash
   # Example: Alert on warnings
   if muster events --type Warning --since 5m | grep -q .; then
     echo "Warning events detected!"
   fi
   ```

### Event Analysis

1. **Timeline Analysis**: Use `--since` and `--until` to understand event sequences
2. **Correlation**: Compare events across related resources (ServiceClass + MCPServer)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring issues or patterns

### Operational Guidelines

1. **Warning Events**: Always investigate Warning events promptly
2. **Recovery Events**: Monitor recovery success rates
3. **Tool Availability**: Track tool availability patterns for capacity planning
4. **Execution Monitoring**: Monitor workflow execution success rates

## Event Retention and Cleanup

### Kubernetes Mode
- Events follow Kubernetes TTL policies (typically 1 hour)
- Use external logging solutions for long-term retention
- Consider event aggregation for monitoring

### Filesystem Mode
- Events persist in `events.log` file
- Manual cleanup required
- Suitable for development and debugging

## Integration with Monitoring Tools

### Prometheus Integration
Events can be scraped and converted to metrics for dashboards and alerting.

### Log Aggregation
Events can be forwarded to log aggregation systems for analysis and retention.

### Custom Dashboards
Event data can power operational dashboards showing system health and activity.

## Conclusion

Muster's event system provides comprehensive visibility into system operations. By understanding event types, their meanings, and troubleshooting approaches, operators can effectively monitor, diagnose, and maintain muster deployments.

Regular event monitoring, combined with proper alerting and response procedures, ensures reliable operation of muster-managed services and workflows.
